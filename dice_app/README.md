# dice_app

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This application we have built to use stateful widget. This is how we can make UI react and respond.
In this, we have used 6 images and with the help of those images whenever the user touches the dice image
it changes with a different image, and that's how a user feels the number is getting changed on clicking it.
